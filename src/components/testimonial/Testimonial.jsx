I had the pleasure of working with him for seven months at Forecasty.AI - where he served as a data scientist and I as the CTO.

Tuhin's ability to build not only AI models but also entire UIs around them, and to blend in the latest developments e.g. around online ML, event streaming, cloud deployment and NLP, was fascinating.

He was a fountain of ideas.

Tuhin would be an asset to any team remotely having to deal with AI.`,

Tuhin exudes confidence because he gives a 110% of himself to achieve his goals, no matter how far out of reach they may seem. Team player, go-getter, not to forget his strong Java web development abilities, that's Tuhin in a nutshell.`,
